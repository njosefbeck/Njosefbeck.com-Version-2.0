Stylesheet: Main Stylesheet

Here's where the magic happens. Here, you'll see we are calling in
the separate media queries. The base mobile goes outside any query
and is called at the beginning, after that we call the rest
of the styles inside media queries.

The text above mostly comes from the stylesheets founds in the Bones WP theme: http://themble.com/bones

/**********************
IMPORTING PARTIALS
These files are needed at the beginning so that we establish all our mixins, functions, and variables that we'll be using across the whole project.

For this project, we just have two partials.
**********************/

// Sass variables
@import "partials/variables";

// Sass mixins
@import "partials/mixins";

/**********************
BASE (MOBILE) SIZE
This is our mobile style. It's what people see on their phones! If you set a great foundation, you won't need to add too many styles in the other stylesheets. Keep it light!
**********************/

// styles in base.scss
@import "breakpoints/base";

/*********************
LARGER MOBILE DEVICES
This is for devices like the Galaxy Note or something that's
larger than an iPhone but smaller than a tablet. Let's call them
tweeners.
*********************/

@media only screen and (min-width: 400px) {
	
	//styles in 400up.scss
	@import "breakpoints/400up";
	
} // end of media query

/*********************
TABLET & SMALLER LAPTOPS
This is the average viewing window. So Desktops, Laptops, and
in general anyone not viewing on a mobile device. Here's where
you can add resource intensive styles.
*********************/

@media only screen and (min-width: 600px) {

	// styles in 600up.scss
	@import "breakpoints/600up";

} // end of media query

/*********************
DESKTOP
This is the average viewing window. So Desktops, Laptops, and
in general anyone not viewing on a mobile device. Here's where
you can add resource intensive styles.
*********************/
@media only screen and (min-width: 800px) {

	// styles in 800up.scss
	@import "breakpoints/800up";

} // end of media query
